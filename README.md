This Java program is a **Mad Libs generator** that asks the user for three words (a **noun**, **verb**, and **adjective**) and fills them into a story template using **`indexOf()`** and **`substring()`** methods to replace placeholders.

It contains basic string manipulation, user input handling, and program structure.

## Features
- Prompts the user for a **noun**, **verb**, and **adjective**  
- Uses **String parsing** (`indexOf` and `substring`) to find and replace placeholders (`<noun>`, `<verb>`, `<adjective>`)

- Bonus feature: The seperate story creation code allows the user to create their own basic story and type out their own template without the predefined template
